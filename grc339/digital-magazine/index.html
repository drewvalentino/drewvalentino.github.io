                            <h2>The Rise of Collecting</h2>
                            <p> Explored in a series of experiments with young children, the Oddball paradigm describes a phenomenon where people's brains respond to unusual or unique stimuli. Essentially, things that happen out of the expected or out of the norm fall into this pattern, and finding fun and unusual collectibles can trigger this chemical response. Therein, collecting can actually be considered in some way a biological imperative. (Source: Lovetoknow.com)</p>
