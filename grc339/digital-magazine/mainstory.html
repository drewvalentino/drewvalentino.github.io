                        <figcaption>Typically, individuals collect things for more than one reason, finding their love of bringing stuff home mixed up in an indiscernible jumble of thoughts and feelings that-when asked to vocalize-almost always turns into the phrase "I don't know, I just liked it." While that may be true, underneath that sentiment are some serious motivations and psychological reasons for why people collect the things that they do.</figcaption>

                    <h2>The Rise of Collecting</h2>
                    <p>Why do people collect things? Every collection of objects has a unique story, and each individual collector has a distinctly personal reason for what brought them to their hobby. Although not all of these reasons are conscious, it's undeniable that humans like to gather stuff into piles, and they often enjoy putting those piles on display. Find out which breed of collector you are and which ones are your top reasons for catching the collecting bug.

                        <figcaption>Trinkets are fun to collect and share with others. Many teens have started collecting keychains and blindboxes, showing off their collections online or partaking in their own secret stashes of cuteness.</figcaption>
                    </figure>
                    <p>Sentimental Attachments: Almost everyone has a small collection of personal memorabilia that has familial and emotional meaning. These sentimental collections of old family photos, greeting cards from friends, family, or lovers, flower petals from meaningful bouquets, strips of ribbon from gift wrappings, seashells, and other small reminders can bring back happy memories of lost people and past times. Although these fragments aren't usually purchased, that doesn't mean they aren't purposefully and carefully curated. </p>
                    <p>Connect to Childhood: Others have collections of stuff from their youth, such as sports cards, comic books, dolls, teddy bears, matchbox cars, and other things that they loved as a kid. In the same way that family photos can help you relive your favorite moments with your loved ones, childhood mementos offer up the chance to connect to that special time in your life. </p>

These award-winning miniature animals and their life-like environments have inspired the imagination and creativity of countless children all over the world.</figcaption>

                    <p>To Gain More Knowledge and Learn About Something New: A fundamental aspect of professional collecting (such as the practices in archival work) is learning from the objects in a collection. Each independent item can tell a story about the person who collected it, the period it was purchased in, what it meant to the original owner by how well it was taken care of, and so much more. You don't have to be a collegiate educated collector to be able to pursue knowledge through the items you find.</p>

Scientists and artists like Albert Einstein, Leonardo da Vinci, Frida Kahlo, and Marie Curie recorded their ideas, insights, and personal struggles through journaling. Keeping a journal is a self-care practice that can powerfully impact your well-being. (Source: Dayoneapp.com)</p>
